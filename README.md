# DES-Algorithm
# For this project, I have implemented a DES algorithm to perform encyrption and decryption on a plaintext. The output will also show the DES runtime for subkey generation, encryption, and decryption.

# DES is symmetric block cipher type that encrypts data in 64-bit blocks with 56-bit key, uses 16 rounds of computational function, generates 48-bit sub-key in each of 16 rounds. 
# DES performs Initial, Final, Expansion, and P-Box permutations with S-Box substitution methods on input text/message. 
# Its structure type is Fesitel. A similar method called Triple DES or 3DES was introduced to be used instead of DES, which used encryption 3 times for increasing to enhance level of security.
# The problem with 3DES was having slow performance due to its way of using encryption method more than once
